# DIBL-Compensation
My project represents an ultra-low-power self-biased CMOS voltage reference with drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect compensation. The design achieves significant improvements in line sensitivity (0.016%/V) and power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) by employing an adaptive gate-source voltage (VGS) control mechanism.
